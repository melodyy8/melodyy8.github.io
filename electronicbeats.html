			<p>Welcome to the electronic beats page! Here you can find my House/Rap beats! Although most of these were made when I was repressing, I did put a lot of time into them, so I wanted to share them too! You can click on the links to view the PDFs and audio, and I hope you enjoy!</p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>5:17</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>I made this beat in December 2018, when my friend and I released rap songs together. This was the first beat I ever released, and I used a lot of brass and woodwind sounds. I tried to create a more "regal" effect by using trumpets.</p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>2:55</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>This was the first beat I made using LMMS! It's short and simple, but has some interesting sounds and chords. I experimented with using accidentals and dissonance to set a more energetic mood.</p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>3:51</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>This was the second beat I made using LMMS! It's a little longer and more complex than the first one, and I experimented with more creative drum and cymabl rhythms. I also played around with chords and different instruments for an adventurous sound!</p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>2:28</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>I made this beat in Garageband, and it was originally going to be used for a more aggressive rap song, so I tried to capture the mood by using a simple melody but a driving bass and drum pattern. I switched between a half-speed and a normal speed drum pattern to make it sound like more energetic when the song needed to.</p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>2:07</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>I made this beat in Garageband, and it was originally the second half of the rap song that used the Checkmate beat. I used Major chords and notes to create a more celebratory and positive mood. I also added a blues scale improvisation at the end to make it sound more fun and energetic.</p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>3:42</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>I transcribed this beat onto MuseScore, giving it a more acoustic sound. I tried to find instruments that sounded accurate and complimented each other well. I really enjoyed the transcription process and I felt like it captured the mood and feel of the original beat!</p>
