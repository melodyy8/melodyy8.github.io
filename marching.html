				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>3 (Nebula, Star, Supernova)</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>Total: 7:38<br>
					Nebula: 2:00<br>
					Star: 2:26<br>
					Supernova: 3:12</p>
				<h4>Show Length: </h4>
				<p>~8:00</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>This was my first ever field show! I wrote it for marching band, and it's space themed. I used music from a variety of sources, like Kevin Macleod, Gravity (2013), and Super Mario Galaxy 2. The three movements represent a star's journey through life, and I tried to create a lot of dynamic and tempo contrast to make the show more lively. </p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>3 (Parts I, II, III)</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>Total: 8:19<br>
					Part I: 3:29<br>
					Part II: 2:54<br>
					Part III: 1:56</p>
				<h4>Show Length: </h4>
				<p>~8:40</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>This was my first drum corps show! I wrote it during my freshman year of college, and I based it off of the Avengers. The three parts use music from Marvel movies, and I also included some original parts to link the different sections together. I tried to use more complicated rhythms and notes because drum corps is at a higher level than marching band, so I wanted my music to reflect that.</p>
