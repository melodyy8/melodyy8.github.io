				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>4 (Parts 1-4)</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>Total: 5:07 <br>
					Part 1: 1:47 <br>
					Part 2: 0:56 <br>
					Part 3: 1:00 <br>
					Part 4: 1:24</p>
				<h4>Difficulty: </h4>
				<p>Beginner</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>The Playtime Suite is made up of 4 beginner-level pieces, each one relatively short and simple. I wrote these pieces when I was 13, using manuscript paper, and I recently transcribed them online using MuseScore. These pieces evoke feelings of childhood, nostalgia, and fun.</p>

				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>3:39</p>
				<h4>Difficulty: </h4>
				<p>Intermediate</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>I wrote this transcription for an a cappella group, using MuseScore. I remember this song from when I was younger, and I wanted to transcribe it as accurately as possible to capture the mood and energy of it. </p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>2:24</p>
				<h4>Difficulty: </h4>
				<p>Advanced</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>This song was my first attempt at writing piano music in a more classical format. It's not really a sonatina, but at the time, I didn't know a better name for it. I struggled to finish the piece for a long time, but I recently managed to write an ending for it that I thought was fitting!</p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>3:33</p>
				<h4>Difficulty: </h4>
				<p>Advanced</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>This was the first piano battle I wrote, using NoteFlight. The original song is from Plants vs. Zombies, which was a very popular game when I was younger. I added drums and cymbals to keep the rhythm and give a little more body to the sound.</p>
