			<p>Hi! I'm Melody, and I'm an aspiring composer and music artist. Music has always been a big part of my life, and it's one of my favorite things to do! <br> <br>
				I started playing piano when I was 7, and I started writing music when I was 13. My first songs were simple piano pieces, but I quickly started learning more instruments and writing music in many different genres. As of now, I've learned 8 instruments, and written almost 50 pieces of music in more than 6 genres! <br> <br>
				I have experience using multiple mediums like MuseScore, LMMS, and manuscript paper. My favorite is probably Musescore, which is what I use for my orchestral and marching ensemble compositions. <br> <br>
				I love writing music because it allows me to express my emotions and use my creativity in a way I'm passionate about! The way that different notes and chords can come together to make beautiful sound is just so inspiring, and it always feels amazing listening to a finished piece and recognizing the emotions and thoughts put into it! <br> <br>
				As for future plans, I hope to branch out even more and try writing pop songs! One of my biggest dreams was always to be able to sing, and while the circumstances of my life have made it very difficult so far, I certainly don't want to give up that dream yet! I also want to try writing music for anime, because the music always sounds really pretty yet very meaningful and deep, but I'm not ready for that level of musical complexity yet... <br> <br>
				Anyway, thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy my music! <br><br> 
				- Melody :) </p>
