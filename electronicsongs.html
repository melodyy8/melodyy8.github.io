				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>3:25</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>My first attempt at writing an electronic song! I was 16, and I used Garageband. I experimented a lot with the genre of this song, so it had some electro/house sounds, a little bit of dupstep, and some more dance-y melodies. </p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>2:30</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>This song is a part two to Sync Pyrotechnics! Unfortunately, it's not quite finished, but I really enjoy what I have so far, so I decided to include this song. It starts out slow and somber, leaving one to wonder how it's related to the bright and energetic first song, but when the buildup starts, the mood quickly changes!</p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>4:35</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>I wrote this song using LMMS, and it took me over 500 days to finish! I started writing it at the beginning of 2020, but had to stop because I was busy with school and had other personal issues. I started working on the song again in May 2021 and finally finished it! I called it "Dance of Euphoria" because this song reminds me of my personal journey and how much happier I am now! It reminds me that things get better, and the positive/upbeat sound gives me optimism and fills me with hope.</p>

				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>1</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>3:23</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>This song was my first (and only) song I wrote using BeepBox, which is a really interesting online 8-bit composer! It's an arrangement of Cake By The Ocean and although it's very simple, I thought it sounded nice!</p>
