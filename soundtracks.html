				<h4>Number of Pieces: </h4>
				<p>3 (Parts I, II, III)</p>
				<h4>Length: </h4>
				<p>Total: 9:07<br>
					Part I: 2:40<br>

					Part III: 4:11</p>
				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>I wrote this soundtrack for my final project in my Greek Literature class! We had studied the Iliad earlier, so I wanted to do something creative by creating a soundtrack to accompany some scenes from the story! I experimented with leitmotifs a lot, and I tried to use different instruments to convey different moods such as tension between Achilles and Agamemnon, or vulnerability when Achilles cries in front of Thetis. </p>

				<h4>Description: </h4>
				<p>This was my first full-length game soundtrack! I wrote it when I was 17, and this is probably the project I spent the most continuous time on! At 13 pieces and over 26 minutes of music, it's by far my longest and most complicated work. I'm especially proud of the final boss theme because it uses motifs and melodies from every other song, giving the sense that everything before was leading up to this final moment. The game was meant to be similar to Plants vs. Zombies, so I wrote themes for the different levels and settings, as well as menu music, and sound effects for the end of a level.</p>
